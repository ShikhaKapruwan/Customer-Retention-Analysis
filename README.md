# Customer-Retention-Analysis
RFM-Based Customer Retention Analysis using Excel and Power Bi

## Overview
This Customer Retention Analysis project leverages RFM segmentation to categorize customers based on their transaction history. The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Excel, and key insights were visualized through interactive dashboard in Power BI. The project includes a Business Requirements Document (BRD) and is hosted on Github as part of a portfolio to demonstrate analytical and visualization skills.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to identify and analyse customer retention patterns using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation. By leveraging Excel and Power BI, this analysis helps businesses understand customer behaviour, identify at-risk customers, and develop strategies to improve retention.
